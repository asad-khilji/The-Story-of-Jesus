        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Polytheistic Period</h2>
        <p class="post-text">There were five people who were very pious people. After they passed away the devils told the people to make statues of these people to remind them how pious they were. Several generations later they started to glorify these statues. They eventually started worshipping these statues. Allah sent Nuh to bring these people back to Tawheed. Nuh preached to his people for 950 years until the flood came and destroyed them. The wealthy people were the first to reject Nuh. The poor people were the first to accept the message of Nuh. Nuh said to his people listen to me I am not asking you for any compensation. I am only calling you to Tawheed. After 950 years Nuh makes dua to Allah against his own people. Then Allah closed the door for repentance for these people. Allah then orders Nuh to build an ark. The flood comes and destroys everyone but Nuh and few people are safe on the ark along with 2 of each species of the animals. After the flood the ark came to rest on Mount Judi.</p>
