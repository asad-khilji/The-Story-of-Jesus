        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Grandmother of Jesus</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The grandmother of Jesus said to God, "I consecrate for Your Service what is in my womb so accept it from me, Indeed You are the All Hearing and The All Knowing." But when she delivered her she said "My Master I have delivered a female" God knows best who she delievered and the male is not like the female. And so she said "I have named her Maryam and I seek refuge for her in You and for her descendants from Satan the expelled."</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Raising of Maryam</h2>
        <p class="post-text">So her Master accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zachariah. Every time Zachariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said "O Maryam from where is this provision coming from?" She said "It is from God Indeed God provides for whom He wills without account." At that Zachariah called upon his Master saying My Master grant me from Yourself a good offspring, Indeed You are hearer of supplications."</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Supplication of Zachariah</h2>
        <p class="post-text">This is a mention of the love and care of Your Master to His slave Zachariah. When he called to His Master a private supplication. He said "My Master indeed my bones have weakened and my head has filled with white and never have I been in my supplication to You, my Master, unhappy. And indeed I fear the successors after me and my wife has been barren so give me from Yourself an heir, who will inherit me and inherit from the family of Jacob nd make him My Master pleasing to You."</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Glad Tidings of John</h2>
        <p class="post-text">He was told "O Zachariah We give glad tidings of a boy whose name shall be John and We have not assigned to any before this name." He said "My Master how can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached extreme old age?" The angel said Your Master says "It is easy for Me for I created you while you were nothing" Zachariah said" My Master make for me a sign" He said "Your sign shall be that you will not speak to the people for three days and three nights." So he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt God in the morning and afternoon. God said "O John take the scripture with determination" And We gave him judgement while yet a boy. And affection from Us and purity and he was fearing of God. And dutiful to his parents and he was not a disobedient tyrant. And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he is raised alive.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Birth of Jesus</h2>
        <p class="post-text">And mention in the book the story of Maryam when she withdrew from her family to a place towards the east. And she took in seclusion from them a screen. Then We sent to her our angel and he represented himself to her as a well proportioned man. She said "Indeed I seek refuge in the Most loving and caring from you so leave me if you should be fearing of God." He said "I am only the messenger of your Master to give you news of a pure boy." She said "How can I have a boy when no man has touched me?" He said Your Master says "It is easy for Me and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter already decreed." So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place. And the pains of child birth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said "Oh I wish had died before this and was forgotten." But a voice called to her saying "Do not be sad your Master has provided beneath you a stream and shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates. So eat and drink and be contented and if you see anyone tell them I have vowed a fast and shall not speak to anyone."</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The First Miracle of Jesus</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Then she brought him to her people carrying him. They said "O Maryam you have certainly done a thing unprecendented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste" So she pointed to him They said "How can we speak to a child in the cradle?" Jesus said while in the cradle "Indeed I am the slave of God. He has given me the scripture and made me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and charity as long as I remain alive. And made me dutiful to my mother and He has not made me a wretched tyrant. And peae be on me the day I was born, the day I will die, and the day I am raised alive." That is Jesus the son of Maryam. It is not befitting that God should take a son. When He decrees a matter He only says to it Be! and it is. Jesus said "And indeed God is my Master and your Master so worship Him alone. That is the straight path.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Miracles of Jesus</h2>
        <p class="post-text">And remember when Jesus, the son of Maryam, spoke to the people in the cradle, and in maturity, and when he designed from clay a bird with God's permission and blew into it and it became a bird with God's permission, and he healed the blind and the leper with God's permission, and he brought the dead back to life with God's Permission.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Last Supper</h2>
        <p class="post-text">And remember when the disciples of Jesus said "O Jesus, son of Maryam, can your Master send down to us a tablespread with food from heaven?" Jesus said "Fear God, if you should be believers" They said "We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses." Jesus, the son of Maryam, said "O God send down to us a tablespread with food from heaven to be a festival for the first of us and the last of usand a sign from You. And provide for Us, and You are the best of providers." God said "Indeed I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you, then indeed I, I will punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished anyone among the worlds."</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Day of Judgement</h2>
        <p class="post-text">And beware of a day when God will say "O Jesus, son of Maryam, did you say to the people "Take me and my mother as gods besides God" He will say "How perfect are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I said it, You would have known it. You know what is in myself and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed it is you who is the knower of the unseen. I said not to them except what You commanded me to worship God My Master And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them but when you took me up You were watching over them and You are over all things witness. If You should punish them they are Your slaves, but if You forgive them it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise." God will say "That is the day when the truthful will beenfit from their truthfulness. For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow and they will abide therin eternally. God being pleased with them and they with Him. That is the great attainment. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them. And He is over all things capable.</p>
