        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Creation of Allah</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In the Beginning there was only Allah and nothing else besides Allah. Allah first created His throne and then the pen. Allah ordered the pen to write. The pen said what shall I write. Allah told it to write everything up to the last hour. After 50,000 years Allah created the seven heavens or universes. We are in the first heaven. The distance between each heaven is like a ring in the desert. Allah created everything within the universes and it took 6 days. Then Allah rose above the throne. Allah did this in stages to teach us about patience. Allah created the angels out of light. Allah created the Jinn who are made from fire and air. The Jinn caused corruption on the earth. Allah decides to create another representative on the earth. Allah said to the angels I am placing another khalifa on the earth. The angels were confused why Allah would create another creation that would cause corruption. Allah said I know that which you do not know. There would be people who would rise above themselves and become better than the angels.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The First Breath of Humanity</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Allah ordered the angels to gather all the different types of clay from the earth. Allah mixed the earth with water and created the first human being. The angels and Iblis were watching. Iblis became jealous of Adam. Allah told the angels to bowed down before Adam when I blow My spirit into Him. The spirit started in the head then his nose and Adam sneezed. The angels told Adam to say Alhamdulillah so Adam said Alhamdulillah. Adam saw the fruits of Jannah and he wanted to grab it even though his spirit had not reached his legs yet. Allah told Adam to say to the angels peace and to tell them their names. Adam told them their names. Allah took all of us out of Adam's back. Allah took a convenant from us that Am I not your Master? We all said Yes. The angels bowed down before Adam except for Iblis, who was a Jinn. Allah told Iblis what prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you. Iblis said I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay. This is the first act of racism. Allah told Iblis to get out from Jannah. Iblis turned away from the obedience of Allah. Iblis said give me time until they are resurrected. Allah said you have been given time. Iblis blamed Allah for his disobedience. Iblis said I will get the children of Adam from in front of them, behind them, their right, and left. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Temptations of Satan</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Adam is in Jannah and enjoying everything but he felt lonely. Adam was put to sleep and when he wakes up he finds a women before him. Adam said who are you. She said I am a women. Adam said why are you here. She said I have been created for you. The angels said to Adam what is her name. Adam said her name is Hawa. She is created from the rib of Adam. Allah told Adam you and your wife enter the Jannah and eat from wherever you want but do not even come close to this tree or you will be from the wrongdoers. Allah said Iblis is your enemy so take him as a enemy. Iblis took his sweet time and he whispered to Adam and Hawa. Iblis comes to them in stages and not all at once. Iblis said to them eat from this tree and you will stay in Jannah forever. Adam and Hawa eat from the tree and then their clothes are removed. Adam and Hawa feel shy and they cover themselves from the leaves of Jannah. Adam and Hawa repent and Allah accepts their repentance. Then Allah says to go down all of you as enemies to each other. Then Adam, Hawa, and Iblis are on the earth.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Beginning of Humanity on Earth</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Allah says to children of Adam We have brought You clothing to cover yourselves and to beautify yourself. The best of clothing is the clothing of taqwa. Adam landed in India and Hawa landed in Makkah and they met in Makkah. Adam was sad because he missed Jannah. Allah consoled Adam that he will enter Jannah again if he followed Allah's guidance. Hawa would give birth to twins a male and a female. The male from one pregnancy was arranged to marry a female from a different pregnancy. Adam had two children Qabil and Habil. Qabil was arranged to marry Habil's sister and Habil was arranged to marry Qabil's sister. Qabil wanted to marry his own sister. Qabil and Habil were ordered to make a sacrifice before Allah. Qabil was a sheperd and Habil was a farmer. Habil's sacrifice was accepted and Qabil's sacrifice was not accepted. Qabil got jealous and said to Habil I will kill you. Habil said if you raise your hand to kill me I will not raise my hand to kill you. Qabil killed Habil. Qabil did not know what to do. Then Allah sent a crow that buried another crow. So Qabil buried his brother.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Adam Returns to Jannah</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Adam passes the legacy of prophethood to his son Sheath. Adam then sends his sons to look for some fruits. The angels find them and say what are you doing. They said we are looking for fruits. The angels said go back to your father for he is dying. They went back and Adam had passed. Allah says that every soul shall taste death. The angels show them how to wash the body and bury it.</p>
